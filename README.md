# Simple Deathscreen For FiveM Servers
This is my first FiveM Script but it's a simple death screen that makes the player wait a set time before respawning. You can also change that amount of time.

## How To Install On Your Server
1. Download The Simple Deathscreen
2. Extract It Using WinRAR or 7Zip
3. drag simpledeathscreen into your resources folder
4. ensure simpledeathscreen in server.cfg
5. Enjoy!
